// healthCheck for correlation-configs — the shared ISC probe contract.
//
// Every configuration type in this app health-checks the same way: resolve the
// OAuth client credential and the tenant, fail closed when either is missing,
// otherwise acquire a token and probe exactly ONE ISC endpoint. The shared contract
// asserts that sequence; this file pins the endpoint and check name.
